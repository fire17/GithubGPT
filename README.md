**GithubGPT**

Welcome to GithubGPT, a powerful tool that allows you to use the power of large language models to automate various tasks on GitHub.

GithubGPT serves as the entry point for our suite of automation abilities, including "Readme2Repo", "Issue2PR" and "Repo2Repo Variations". By using large language models, GithubGPT allows you to easily understand the structure and content of your GitHub repository and generate various files, branches and pull requests.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to connect your GitHub account to our service by following this [link](https://githubgpt.com/connect).

Once you have connected your account, you can start using GithubGPT by creating issues on your repository. Our service will automatically detect when an issue is created and call the appropriate tool from our suite of automation abilities to complete the task.

### Examples of Usage
- To generate a new repository based on a README file, create an issue with the title "Generate Repository" and provide the link to the README file in the issue body. Our service will then call Readme2Repo and generate a new repository with all the necessary files.
- To optimize the performance of your repository, create an issue with the title "Optimize Performance" and provide a detailed explanation of what changes you would like to make. Our service will then call Repo2Repo Variations and generate a new branch with the optimized code.
- To create a cross-language variant of your repository, create an issue with the title "Create Cross-Language Variant" and specify the target language in the issue body. Our service will then call Repo2Repo Variations and generate a new branch with the cross-language variant.

### Automatic Pull Requests

Every issue created by the repository owner is automatically calling the Issue2PR. Our service will create a new branch with the changes specified in the issue, and run GitHub actions to test the branch. If the tests pass, a pull request will be automatically submitted to the repository.
